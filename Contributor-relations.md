Contributors are what keeps OSS projects alive.

The golden rule of encouraging contribution is to thank, thank and thank again.

For contributions towards a release ([[milestone|Milestones]]) we should remember thank our contributors at the point of contribution (via issue comments, PR comments, etc.), in the release notes and again in our post release tweets. We can also expand this to release announcements on our website.

For contributions which sit outside a release, we should again thank the contributor at the point of contribution and then also on Twitter and perhaps later in a 'news' or 'current activity' section on our website.
