We use [Huboard](https://huboard.com/FakeItEasy/FakeItEasy) for a Kanban style view of the issues and their progress. The FakeItEasy owners will move the issues across the board as they progress.

### Columns

* **Backlog** - the default placement of all new issues. Issues in the backlog are yet to be understood or require analysis and/or discussion with regard to functionality, implementation, etc.
* **Ready** - the issue is understood, labelled correctly and work can commence immediately.
* **Working** - the issue is currently being worked on.
* **Done** - work has finished on the issue and it can be closed. In the case of a code change, this means the work has been merged to master and the functionality is complete. In the case of a question, the question has been answered and the user asking the question has acknowledged it. Other issues types as appropriate.
