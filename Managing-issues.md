### Issue labels

Issues should be [[labelled|Issue labels]] ASAP. All issues should default to being labelled **0 - Backlog** (see Huboard below) and **P2** as the default priority level, as well as appropriate [[general labels|Issue labels#general]].

### Huboard

Issues can be moved across the board by dragging them. This updates the [[workflow labels|Issue-labels#workflow]] accordingly) and owners can be assigned to issues by dragging their gravatar onto them. The beta version of Huboard also allows closed issues to be seen in the final column and for issues to be closed from the Huboard UI.
