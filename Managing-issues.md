### Issue labels

All issues should default to being labelled **0 - Backlog** (see Huboard below) and **P2** as the default priority level, as well as appropriate [[general labels|Issue labels#general]]. This should happen ASAP after an issue is created. As the issue progresses, the labels should be kept up to date to reflect any insights gained.

### Priorities

Issues should default to priority level 2 (label **P2**). If an issue is judged to be important, e.g. a major bug, a new feature with great value, etc. then it should be promoted to **P1**. An issue which is a nice to have but less important than others should be demoted to **P3**. If there are very few **P2** issues open then issues may be selectively promoted from **P3** to **P2**.

### Huboard

Issues can be moved across the board by dragging them. This updates the [[workflow labels|Issue-labels#workflow]] accordingly) and owners can be assigned to issues by dragging their gravatar onto them. The beta version of Huboard also allows closed issues to be seen in the final column and for issues to be closed from the Huboard UI.
