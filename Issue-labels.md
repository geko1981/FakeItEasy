Issues will be labelled by the FakeItEasy owners after they are raised. The labels for a given issue may change during its lifetime as more insight is gained.

### General

The are descriptive labels which help to manage the list of issues. If you feel an issue is incorrectly labelled please bring this to the attention of the owners by adding a comment to the issue.

* **breaking** - a breaking change which requires a major version bump
* **bug** - a fault in the implementation of a current feature
* **build** - an issue related to the building of FakeItEasy packages from source code
* **contribution** - the implementation of the issue includes a contribution from a contributor (non-FakeItEasy organisation member).
* **deprecation** - the issue involves the deprecation of existing features.
* **documentation** - an issue related to documentation of FakeItEasy features or meta information, e.g. website, wiki, contribution guidelines, readme, etc.
* **duplicate** - the issue is a duplicate of another issue (and should normally be closed).
* **easyfix** - used to communicate low hanging fruit to potential contributors
* **enhancement** - a new feature or a change to a feature which enhances FakeItEasy
* **invalid** - the issue is invalid and has been raised in error.
* **question** - a question about FakeItEasy or an idea for a new feature or change to an existing feature which  is open to and/or requires comment and discussion
* **refactoring** - a technical improvement which does not add any new features or change existing features. This label can be used in addition to other labels if the issue happens to involve a significant amount of refactoring.
* **removal** - removal of an existing feature
* **taken** - the issue has been assigned to a contributor (non-FakeItEasy organisation member).
* **wontfix** - the issue has been recognised but the coordinators have decided that it will not be implemented.

### Priority
Labels **P1**, **P2** and **P3** are used to assign priority to issues. If you feel an issue is incorrectly prioritised please bring this to the attention of the owners by adding a comment to the issue.

* **P1** - the issue is of high value and should be addressed ASAP.
* **P2** - (default priority) the issue has considerable value and is a candidate for implementation when resources are available.
* **P3** - the issue has value but is considered to be less beneficial than issues currently assigned P2. Issues may be selectively promoted from P3 to P2 when there are very few open P2 issues.

### Workflow
The labels **0 - Backlog**, **1 - Ready**, **2 - Working** and **3 - Done** are used by [[Huboard]] to manage the workflow of issues. Each label corresponds to a column in Huboard. The numeric prefix determines the column order.

The communication between GitHub and Huboard is two-way. If you manually assign one of these labels to an issue in GitHub then the issue will move to the appropriate column in Huboard. If you move an issue to a column in Huboard then the appropriate label will be added to the issue in GitHub (and the label for the previous column will be removed).
