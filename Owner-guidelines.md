# Issue Labels

### General
Issues should be labelled appropriately with:

* **breaking** A breaking change which requires a major version bump
* **bug** A fault in the implementation of a current feature
* **build** An issue related to the building of FakeItEasy packages from source code
* **contribution** The implementation of the issue includes a contribution from a contributor (non-FakeItEasy organisation member).
* **deprecation** The issue involves the deprecation of existing features.
* **documentation** An issue related to documentation of FakeItEasy features or meta information, e.g. website, wiki, contribution guidelines, readme, etc.
* **duplicate** The issue is a duplicate of another issue (and should normally be closed).
* **easyfix** Used to communicate low hanging fruit to potential contributors
* **enhancement** A new feature or a change to a feature which enhances FakeItEasy
* **invalid** The issue is invalid and has been raised in error.
* **question** A question about FakeItEasy or an idea for a new feature or change to an existing feature which  is open to and/or requires comment and discussion
* **refactoring** Technical improvement which does not add any new features or change existing features. This label can be used in addition to other labels if the issue happens to involve a significant amount of refactoring.
* **removal** Removal of an existing feature
* **taken** The issue has been assigned to a contributor (non-FakeItEasy organisation member).
* **wontfix** The issue has been recognised but the coordinators have decided that it will not be implemented.

### Priority
Labels **P1**, **P2** and **P3** are used to assign priority to issues:

* **P1** The issue is of high value and should be addressed ASAP.
* **P2** (Default priority) The issue has considerable value and is a candidate for implementation when resources are available.
* **P3** The issue has value but is considered to be less beneficial than issues currently assigned **P2**. Issues may be selectively promoted from **P3** to **P2** when there are very few open **P2** issues.

### Workflow
There are used by [Huboard](https://huboard.com/FakeItEasy/FakeItEasy) to manage the workflow of issues:

**0 - Backlog** The default placement of all new issues. Issues in the backlog are yet to be understood or require analysis and/or discussion with regard to functionality, implementation, etc.
**1 - Ready** The issue is understood, labelled correctly and work can commence immediately.
**2 - Working** The issue is currently being worked on.
**3 - Done** Work has finished on the issue and it can be closed. In the case of a code change, this means the work has been merged to master and the functionality is complete. In the case of a question, the question has been answered and the user asking the question has acknowledged it. Other issues types as appropriate.

# Issue Assignment

# Huboard

We use [Huboard](https://huboard.com/FakeItEasy/FakeItEasy) for a Kanban style view of the issues and their progress. Issues can be moved across swimlanes by dragging them (this updates the workflow labels accordingly) and owners can be assigned to issues by dragging their gravatar onto them. The beta version of Huboard also allows closed issues to be seen in the final column and for issues to be closed from the Huboard UI.
